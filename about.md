Hi there, my name is Zito. I'm really passionate about artificial intelligence and its application to solve real world problems. I feel that this technology has the limitless potential to change the world. In the near future, I'm confident that it will completely define how people live their lives.

I started off wanting to be a doctor, but after a semester in medical school I decided it wasn't for me. I taught myself to program and then went on to work in different roles relating to data science and AI. My most recent role involved leading a team across the Asia-Pacific region in implementing machine learning models for debt collection and credit scoring. Currently, I'm taking a graduate degree in Computer Science.

Here I write about my projects, interests, and thoughts. Have a look around! Hopefully you find something interesting.
